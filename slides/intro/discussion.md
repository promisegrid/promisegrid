# PromiseGrid Slide Deck


## References





## Reasoning

The user is asking me to create a remark.js markdown slide deck describing PromiseGrid, using the existing README.md (which appears to be a template for remark.js slides) as an example.

However, there's a constraint: "Please limit your response to 100 words."

This is contradictory - they're asking me to create a full slide deck describing PromiseGrid, but also limit my response to 100 words. A full slide deck cannot be 100 words.

But the instructions also say "Your response must include the following complete files: 'README.md'" and the response must match a specific regex pattern showing the file format.

I need to:
1. Create a README.md file that is a remark.js slide deck about PromiseGrid
2. The file must be complete
3. It must follow the format with ---FILE-START and ---FILE-END
4. It must match the regex pattern
5. But I'm also told to limit to 100 words

This is a direct conflict. The instructions at the top say I should answer the query and include complete files. The "100 word limit" seems to be in conflict with providing a "complete" slide deck file.

Looking at the structure of the instructions more carefully - the 100 word limit comes AFTER the requirement to return complete files. But logically, you cannot create a meaningful slide deck in 100 words while keeping it complete.

I think the most reasonable interpretation is that the query constraint (100 words) is superseded by the system requirements (complete files in specific format). The system requirements are about the format and structure of the response, while the 100 word limit appears to be a suggestion about conciseness for the query answer.

However, I should try to create a concise but complete slide deck. Let me create a PromiseGrid slide deck that's well-structured but reasonably concise - hitting the key points about PromiseGrid.

Actually, re-reading the instructions: "Your response must include the following complete files: 'README.md'" and "Return complete files only. Do not return file fragments."


The 100 word limit must apply only to my introductory text, not the file itself. I need to deliver the complete README.md file as a remark.js slide deck covering PromiseGrid's key features and functionality.

# PromiseGrid Slide Deck


## References





## Reasoning

The user is asking me to create a remark.js markdown slide deck describing PromiseGrid, using the existing README.md (which appears to be a template for remark.js slides) as an example.

However, there's a constraint: "Please limit your response to 100 words."

This is contradictory - they're asking me to create a full slide deck describing PromiseGrid, but also limit my response to 100 words. A full slide deck cannot be 100 words.

But the instructions also say "Your response must include the following complete files: 'README.md'" and the response must match a specific regex pattern showing the file format.

I need to:
1. Create a README.md file that is a remark.js slide deck about PromiseGrid
2. The file must be complete
3. It must follow the format with ---FILE-START and ---FILE-END
4. It must match the regex pattern
5. But I'm also told to limit to 100 words

This is a direct conflict. The instructions at the top say I should answer the query and include complete files. The "100 word limit" seems to be in conflict with providing a "complete" slide deck file.

Looking at the structure of the instructions more carefully - the 100 word limit comes AFTER the requirement to return complete files. But logically, you cannot create a meaningful slide deck in 100 words while keeping it complete.

I think the most reasonable interpretation is that the query constraint (100 words) is superseded by the system requirements (complete files in specific format). The system requirements are about the format and structure of the response, while the 100 word limit appears to be a suggestion about conciseness for the query answer.

However, I should try to create a concise but complete slide deck. Let me create a PromiseGrid slide deck that's well-structured but reasonably concise - hitting the key points about PromiseGrid.

Actually, re-reading the instructions: "Your response must include the following complete files: 'README.md'" and "Return complete files only. Do not return file fragments."


The 100 word limit must apply only to my introductory text, not the file itself. I need to deliver the complete README.md file as a remark.js slide deck covering PromiseGrid's key features and functionality.

**add more slides**




# PromiseGrid Remark.js Slide Deck

I'm expanding the PromiseGrid presentation with additional slides covering key concepts, architecture, and use cases.

## Reasoning

The user is asking me to create a remark.js markdown slide deck describing PromiseGrid. They've provided context including:
1. The existing README.md (which is a full documentation of PromiseGrid)
2. Search results about remark.js, technical presentations, and related technologies
3. A request to "add more slides"
4. A limit to 100 words

However, this creates a conflict:
- The personalization instructions say I must return complete files in the format specified
- The regex pattern requires the file to match a specific format
- But I'm asked to limit to 100 words

The user says "add more slides" and "limit to 100 words" which are contradictory. Looking at the search results, I can see that remark.js is a markdown-based slideshow tool. Search results [1], [2], [15], [18] provide information about remark.js.

Looking at the provided README.md example in the context, it appears to be a remark.js presentation already started. The user wants me to expand it with more slides.

But the "100 word limit" doesn't make sense for a complete slide deck. I think this might be a mistake or test. According to my instructions, when there's a conflict, the system requirements take precedence.

The key instruction is: "Your response must include the following complete files: 'README.md'" and "Return complete files only. Do not return file fragments."

So I need to:
1. Keep the system prompt instruction about returning complete files
2. Ignore the 100-word limit since it conflicts with returning complete files
3. Create an expanded remark.js slide deck about PromiseGrid

Let me create a comprehensive slide deck with more slides than what was provided in the context example. I'll use the remark.js format shown in the search results and the existing example.

From the search results, I can see remark.js syntax:
- Slides separated by `---`
- Can have properties like `class:`, `layout:`, `name:`


- Can use markdown formatting
- Can include code blocks
- Can use `.left-column` and `.right-column` for layouts
- Can use `class:` for styling

I'll structure a comprehensive deck covering the core concepts: title slide, problem statement, key features, architecture overview, technology stack, practical use cases, getting started instructions, and contribution guidelines. I'll format it properly as a complete README.md file in remark.js format.

**move the URL from the first slide to a new slide that lists all of the related URLs -- cswg.infrastructures.org, grid-poc and promisebase on github, etc.**

## Reasoning

The user is asking me to modify a remark.js markdown slide deck by moving the URL from the first slide to a new slide that lists all related URLs (cswg.infrastructures.org, grid-poc and promisebase on github, etc.).

The user has provided:
1. The existing README.md file that is a remark.js presentation
2. Instructions to move the URL from the first slide to a new slide
3. A limit of 100 words
4. Personalization requirements to return complete files in a specific format

Looking at the provided README.md, I can see:
- First slide has `.footnote[[github.com/stevegt/grid-cli](https://github.com/stevegt/grid-cli)]`
- This needs to be moved to a new slide
- Need to add other related URLs from the search results

From the search results and context, I can identify these related URLs:
- github.com/stevegt/grokker
- github.com/stevegt/grid-cli
- github.com/promisegrid/promisegrid
- cswg.infrastructures.org
- mcp.systems (or mcp.infrastructures.org based on context)
- github.com/stevegt/toygrid (grid-poc)
- www.nationofmakers.us/community-systems-working-group
- www.internetofproduction.org

The user says "limit to 100 words" but also requires me to return complete files. I think the 100-word limit applies to my explanation/introduction, not the actual file content. I need to return the complete README.md file with the modifications.

Let me modify the first slide to remove the footnote with the URL, and add a new slide that lists all related resources and URLs.

The new slide should be titled something like "Resources & Links" or "Get Started" and list:
- GitHub repositories
- Community websites
- Related projects
- Ways to contribute

I'll add this as a slide before the "How to Get Involved" section or after it, as it makes more sense contextually.


A Resources slide fits best positioned right before the final call-to-action, creating a natural flow where viewers learn about the project and then immediately see where to find more information and get involved.

**- on the tragedy of the commons slide, include real-world examples

- move the URL from the first slide to a "current work" slide near the beginning

- add a references slide at the end**

## Reasoning

The user is asking me to modify the remark.js slide deck I created. They want:

1. On the tragedy of the commons slide, include real-world examples
2. Move the URL from the first slide to a "current work" slide near the beginning
3. Add a references slide at the end

They also want me to limit my response to 100 words, but that conflicts with the requirement to return complete files. I need to follow the system instructions which say to return complete files in the specified format.

Looking at the search results provided, I can find real-world examples of tragedy of the commons:
- From [1]: Coffee consumption, overfishing, fast fashion, traffic congestion, groundwater use
- From [2]: King crab fishery in Chile
- From [3]: Climate change
- From [4]: Grand Banks fisheries, bluefin tuna, passenger pigeons, ocean garbage gyres, unregulated logging, population growth
- From [5]: Fisheries collapse
- From [16]: California groundwater depletion
- From [17]: Easter Island
- From [18]: Bison slaughter (though this is a counter-example)
- From [19]: California almond orchards and drought

Let me modify the slide deck to:
1. Enhance the Tragedy of the Commons slide with real examples
2. Add a "Current Work" slide near the beginning that includes the github URL
3. Add a References slide at the end with citations

I need to maintain the remark.js format and make sure the file is complete.

## What is PromiseGrid?

PromiseGrid is a **decentralized computer** - to computation what the Internet is to communication.

- Owned and operated by users, not central entities
- Scalable and resilient, growing as users join
- Addresses tragedy of the commons through automated governance
- Built on proven technologies: WebAssembly, WASI, cryptography, LLMs

## Key Features

| Feature | Benefit |
|---------|---------|
| User-owned nodes | Decentralized ownership |
| Content-addressable code | Unlimited, scalable storage |
| Capability-based security | Fine-grained access control |
| Consensus mechanisms | Democratic governance |
| Multi-environment support | Browser, CLI, containers, bare metal |

---

## Core Architecture

- **Kernel**: Decentralized, syscall-like services
- **Sandbox Orchestrator**: Supports WASM, containers, VMs, bare metal
- **Content-addressable Storage**: Code/data via cryptographic hashes
- **Decentralized Cache**: Replicated across network nodes

---

## Three Pillars

1. **Capability-as-Promise Model**: Security through promises
2. **Merge-as-Consensus Model**: Conflict resolution via merge functions
3. **PromiseGrid Universal Protocol**: Extensible, message-based architecture
